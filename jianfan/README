A Python Library for translation between traditional and simplified chinese.

All documentation is in the "docs" directory and online at
http://code.google.com/p/python-jianfan/w/list . If you're just getting started, here's
how we recommend you read the docs:

    * read docs/install.txt for instructions on installing Jianfan.
    * from there you can jump to the HOWTOs (in docs/howto) for specific
      problems, and check out the reference (docs/ref) for gory details.

Docs are updated rigorously. If you find any problems in the docs, or think they
should be clarified in any way, please take 30 seconds to fill out a ticket
here:
